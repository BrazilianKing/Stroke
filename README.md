# Stroke

## Predicting the chances of an individual having a stroke
Edmar Dos Santos

### Context
According to the World Health Organization stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death. Strokes are responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

## Data: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

### For this dataset, there were 5110 rows and 12 columns.

# Methods
### To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:
We sliced, flitered, searched for duplicates and dropped any coloumns that we felt were not import for this particual project.

### Based upon this 

# Results of Models
## The KNN Model was chosen for this set of data with GS as well.
## KNN Model Test Score
### Accuracy: 0.94
## KNN Model w/ GS Test Score
### Accuarcy: 0.94

### This score can be interpreted as saying that our model can account for a 94% accuracy on predicting if someone will have a stroke or not.

## Random Forest was also chosen for this dataset with GS as well.
### 

### This means the number is slightly higher because their were some test that had higher variance from the predictions. It impacts the total dollar amount because they are further away.
### These two metrics can help us predict new sales data within $1,100.

# Recommendations
### I would recommend checking the other models to see if we can find any improvments in our data.

# Next Steps
### I would say that more data needs to be include and to run more models with the new data being included.
